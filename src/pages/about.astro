    <p>
      Hi, and welcome to my space, where I share my expertise, thoughts, insights, and experiences in the field of technical writing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Personal profile</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Technical Writer who believes that communication, written or spoken, opens opportunities to share knowledge, learn, help each other, and build better solutions.
      With over eight years in tech, I have supported users, led a customer care team, and written content that helps people get things done. These experiences shaped my passion for technical writing and gave my work a meaningful direction.
    </p>
    <p>Today, I enjoy turning complex information into clear explanations. I focus on creating helpful, accurate documentation, user and admin guides, API references, onboarding content, and managing the lifecycle of internal knowledge resources.
      I am also passionate about UX writing and how thoughtful language supports better product experiences.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="values">My professional values</h2>
    <p>I first and foremost value trust and transparency, cooperation, open communication, clear expectations, support for growth, teamwork, and a sense of community. These are the values that guide me in my work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Lifelong learning</strong><br />
        I grow 1% every day. Curiosity drives my research, helps me spot gaps, and shapes clearer, more useful content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Care about the details</strong><br />
        I take time to question, test, and polish. Clear documentation starts with careful thinking, not just clean sentences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Integrity and commitment</strong><br />
        I follow through. I take ownership of every task, stay open to feedback, and focus on delivering what others can trust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community and collaboration</strong><br />
        Documentation is a team sport. I bring dedication, pursue shared goals, welcome feedback and brainstorming, and promote collaboration to achieve quality results.
      </li>
    </ul>
