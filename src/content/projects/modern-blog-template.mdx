# Introduction

<p>While learning HTML and CSS through the Mimo app, video tutorials, and independent research, I challenged myself to apply these skills by building a simple website from scratch. My goal was to create a practical showcase that combined learning with hands-on practice.</p>
<p>The website includes several pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intro page</strong> <br /> Introduces the structure of the website and lists the sections included in the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Certificates page</strong> <br /> Displays images of certificates I earned during my studies.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical writing presentation page</strong> <br /> Features a presentation I created for a student intern interested in becoming a developer. A company invited me to explain the technical writing profession, assign practical tasks, and review her work. This was a valuable experience that reflected my teaching and communication skills.</li>
  <li><strong>Style guide comparison page</strong> <br /> Provides a comparison of the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, and the Apple Style Guide. This page reflects my interest in documentation standards and best practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project helped me combine study with practice, deepen my understanding of web development, and present my new experience and some technical writing insights in a creative format.</p>
