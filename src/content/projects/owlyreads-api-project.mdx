## Introduction

<p>The <strong>OwlyReads Catalog API</strong> project is a showcase example of API documentation that manages book inventories across franchise locations. It demonstrates both the approach to API documentation design and the principles of clear, consistent technical writing.</p>

<p>The API allows franchise stores to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add new books or update existing details</strong> <br /> Keeps information about titles, authors, categories, pricing, and availability consistent across all connected systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain stock consistency</strong> <br /> Updates made in one location are reflected across all franchise locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide real-time inventory information</strong> <br /> Staff and e-commerce platforms receive accurate data instantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Search and filter books</strong> <br /> Retrieve books by title, author, category, or series.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project emphasizes technical writing principles such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Each endpoint and schema is explained in simple, actionable language.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Schema names, field formats, and descriptions follow a uniform style.</li>
  <li><strong>Practical examples:</strong> Responses, errors, and schema examples are included to help developers understand usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Documentation is structured so that both technical and non-technical users can navigate it easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this project, I combined API design knowledge with technical writing best practices, producing clear, reliable, and developer-friendly documentation.</p>
