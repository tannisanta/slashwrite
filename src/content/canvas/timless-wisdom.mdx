# Words of wisdom

<p>Quotes and aphorisms have a unique power to touch people deeply because they capture universal experiences in concise, memorable lines. They often speak directly to the heart, inspiring, comforting, or challenging us. This shared wisdom reminds us that many of our struggles, hopes, and dreams are universal.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully crafted and emotionally charged, quotes help us see different perspectives and reveal layers of meaning with just a few words or lines. There are countless words of wisdom out there, but here I share some that have stayed with me.</p>
