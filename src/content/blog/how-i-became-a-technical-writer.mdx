## First clues

From a young age, I was drawn to reading, especially detective stories.
I was always fascinated by the worlds Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie could create with words, and I loved gathering clues alongside the main characters and trying to guess who was guilty of the crime.
I treasured reading and literature, but English as a language also captured my interest.
I was captivated by its rich vocabulary, the multiple meanings words could have, and its varied sentence structures.
While I was good at math, my real passions were English and literature, which became my favorite subjects.

## Following the trail

After finishing school, I didn't hesitate to apply to the philological faculty to major in teaching English and literature.
Philology, literature, and teaching were my main focus during those university years.
Eventually, I graduated with an MA in English and literature and began my teaching and translation career at a private language school.

## An unexpected lead

Soon after, life took an unexpected turn when an IT company headhunted me.
My curiosity and love for learning made this new field exciting, especially since I could use English at work.
I discovered I could help people solve problems and continue to grow by diving into the world of technology.

My first IT role was in customer care. I answered phone calls, managed tickets, reviewed engineers’ responses for language accuracy, and quickly absorbed new product knowledge.
I was soon promoted to application engineer, where I handled feature requests, advanced product support, and collaborated closely with software engineers and developers.
Each day involved communication, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

## Deepening the foundation

Later, I joined a SaaS company as the 34th team member. Starting in customer care, I grew into the Head of Customer Care within six months.
My team soon tripled in size and expanded across Ukraine, China, and Brazil. We handled chats, emails, and calls every day. Though I wore many hats, customer care remained central to my role. I was also fortunate to work with a great team.

I built support processes, created onboarding documentation and quality guidelines, and worked closely with nearly every department. 
Over time, I began to feel the need for a clearer career direction.
I realized I wanted to specialize in one area where I could build genuine expertise.

## Key discoveries

So I stepped back and asked myself: What do I truly enjoy in everyday work? 
Helping people and training others about the product.
Creating department materials and practicing English daily. Learning new things and investigating complex issues. Collaborating with developers, product managers, and QA engineers. The answer was clear to me.
All signs pointed to technical writing. It brought all the puzzle pieces together.

With this clarity, I began exploring technical writing more deeply and reached out to writers I knew. One day, I found an ad for the Eleks Technical Writing Camp. I applied, passed several selection rounds, and joined the course.
It was well-designed, led by experts, and I learned a great deal.
Joining the amazing Eleks Information Development team taught me even more. I’ve kept learning ever since.

## All pieces in place

In many ways, what drew me to this field is exactly what keeps me energized today: a love of learning, the satisfaction of helping others, curiosity, collaboration, and the skill of making complex ideas clear.
I enjoy bringing clarity, structure, and quality to my work. Whatever the task, once I discover the first clue, I’m driven to finish it. Step by step, I build understanding, collaborate with stakeholders, and design solutions that benefit businesses and their users.
Like a detective, I gather clues, question subject matter experts, analyze information, and use all available resources to piece together a complete picture and produce high-quality, accurate documentation.

Looking back, I’m grateful that my love of stories, puzzles, and language all found a place in my work.
Technical writing is where my curiosity, creativity, and drive to help others naturally fit together.
And I'm excited to keep learning, collaborating, and building clarity, one challenge at a time.
