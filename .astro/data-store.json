I answered phone calls, managed tickets, reviewed engineers’ responses for language accuracy, and quickly absorbed new product knowledge.\nI was soon promoted to application engineer, where I handled feature requests, advanced product support, and collaborated closely with software engineers and developers.\nEach day involved communication, problem-solving, and continuous learning.\n\n## Deepening the foundation\n\nLater, I joined a SaaS company as the 34th team member. Starting in customer care, I grew into the Head of Customer Care within six months.\nMy team soon tripled in size and expanded across Ukraine, China, and Brazil. We handled chats, emails, and calls every day. Though I wore many hats, customer care remained central to my role. I was also fortunate to work with a great team.\n\nI built support processes, created onboarding documentation and quality guidelines, and worked closely with nearly every department. \nOver time, I began to feel the need for a clearer career direction.\nI realized I wanted to specialize in one area where I could build genuine expertise.\n\n## Key discoveries\n\nSo I stepped back and asked myself: What do I truly enjoy in everyday work? \nHelping people and training others about the product.\nCreating department materials and practicing English daily. Learning new things and investigating complex issues. Collaborating with developers, product managers, and QA engineers. The answer was clear to me.\nAll signs pointed to technical writing. It brought all the puzzle pieces together.\n\nWith this clarity, I began exploring technical writing more deeply and reached out to writers I knew. One day, I found an ad for the Eleks Technical Writing Camp. I applied, passed several selection rounds, and joined the course.\nIt was well-designed, led by experts, and I learned a great deal.\nJoining the amazing Eleks Information Development team taught me even more. I’ve kept learning ever since.\n\n## All pieces in place\n\nIn many ways, what drew me to this field is exactly what keeps me energized today: a love of learning, the satisfaction of helping others, curiosity, collaboration, and the skill of making complex ideas clear.\nI enjoy bringing clarity, structure, and quality to my work. Whatever the task, once I discover the first clue, I’m driven to finish it. Step by step, I build understanding, collaborate with stakeholders, and design solutions that benefit businesses and their users.\nLike a detective, I gather clues, question subject matter experts, analyze information, and use all available resources to piece together a complete picture and produce high-quality, accurate documentation.\n\nLooking back, I’m grateful that my love of stories, puzzles, and language all found a place in my work.\nTechnical writing is where my curiosity, creativity, and drive to help others naturally fit together.\nAnd I'm excited to keep learning, collaborating, and building clarity, one challenge at a time.","src/content/blog/how-i-became-a-technical-writer.mdx","9c0062bea902ac96","how-i-became-a-technical-writer.mdx","mkdocs-website",{"id":30,"data":32,"body":40,"filePath":41,"digest":42,"legacyId":43,"deferredRender":23},{"title":33,"description":34,"pubDate":35,"heroImage":36,"tags":37,"categories":38,"draft":22,"featured":22,"author":24,"location":39},"MkDocs site for documentation","A beginner-friendly guide to creating an MkDocs website using GitHub Pages",["Date","2025-08-03T00:00:00.000Z"],"https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/minimalist-workspace-with-laptop-cup-coffee-small-plant-symbolizing-productiv_924727-80270.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid&w=740&q=80",[9,21],[21,9],"","MkDocs is a popular static site generator specifically designed for creating documentation websites. It allows you to write your documentation content in Markdown format and automatically generates a static HTML website.\n\nHere are a few reasons why MkDocs is a good choice for technical documentation:\n\n- **Simplicity** \u003Cbr />\nIt has a minimalistic approach, focusing on the essentials of documentation without unnecessary complexity.\n\n- **Markdown support** \u003Cbr />\nWith MkDocs, you can write your documentation content in Markdown, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical contributors.\n\n- **Navigation and search** \u003Cbr />\nMkDocs automatically generates a navigation menu based on the directory structure of your documentation. Additionally, it provides a built-in search functionality that allows users to quickly find the information they need within your documentation.\n\n- **Customizability** \u003Cbr />\nMkDocs offers a range of customizable themes and templates, allowing you to tailor the appearance of your documentation to match your brand or project.\n\n- **Versioning and deployment** \u003Cbr />\nMkDocs supports versioning, making it convenient to manage and publish multiple versions of your documentation.\n\n- **Integration with version control systems (VCS)** \u003Cbr />\nMkDocs works well with VCS like Git. You can store your documentation files in a Git repository, making it easy to collaborate with team members, track changes, and manage contributions.\n\nIn this document, I share the process of building an MkDoc static website and hosting in on GitHub pages.\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n- VS Code (or other source code editor)\n- Python extension installed\n- GitHub account\n- GitHub desktop\n\n\u003Cbr />\n\n# Step-by-step guide\n\nThe instructions below help create a GitHub repository, clone the repository to the local machine, launch the MkDocs website with Python, and publish it to GitHub pages.\n\n## Create GitHub repository\n\n**To create new repository in your GitHub account**\n\n1. Log in to your GitHub account.\n2. At the top left corner, select **+** > **New repository**.\n3. Give a name to your repository.\n4. Select **Public**.\n5. Select **Add a README file**.\n6. For **.gitignore** select **Python**.\n7. (Optional) For the **Choose a license** step, select the **GNU General public license** from the dropdown list.\n8. Select **Create repository**.\nYour repository has been created.\n9. Open your GitHub desktop account and [clone the repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZNIbs_wx8).\n\nNow you can make changes locally and then commit and push them to GitHub account in the web.\n\n## Build website\n\n**To build a website**\n\n1. Open your cloned project in VS Code and open its terminal.\n2. Assuming you have Python already, create virtual Python environment by using the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n    ```\n\n3. Activate it using the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n   source venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n4. Install MkDocs with the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n   pip install mkdocs-material\n    ```\n\n    All the dependencies are downloaded for the website.\n\n5. Created a new website by using the command:\n    ```bash\n    mkdocs new .\n    ```\n\n    You  now have two files created for the website:\n    ```bash\n    INFO     -  Writing config file: ./mkdocs.yml\n    INFO     -  Writing initial docs: ./docs/index.md\n    ```\n\n6. Run the website locally by using the command:\n    ```bash\n   mkdocs serve\n    ```\n    The website runs locally at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```\n\n7. Open the website by copying and pasting the local host address into the browser address bar.\nThe website is served and can be accesses locally.\n![Startpage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tannisanta/tt-techcomm-project/main/img/mkdocs_basic.jpg)\n\nIf you need to make a pause and activate the env some time later, use the following commands in the VS Code terminal of the project:\n\n```bash\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\n## Configure website\n\nThe website has the initial configuration. You can add configuration using the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) documentation. Let us proceed with the basic setup.\n\n**To configure MkDocs website**\n\n1. Open your mkdocs.yml in VS Code.\n2. Edit the content to change theme, define language, add a search box, and set colours:\n\n    ```yml\n   site_name: Your website name\n   theme: \n      name: material\n      features:\n         - navigation.tabs\n         - navigation.sections\n         - toc.integrate\n         - navigation.top\n         - search.suggest\n         - search.highlight\n         - content.tabs.link\n         - content.code.annotation\n         - content.code.copy\n         - toc.follow\n         - navigation.path\n      language: en\n      palette:\n         - scheme: default\n            toggle:\n               icon: material/toggle-switch-off-outline \n               name: Switch to dark mode\n            primary: indigo\n            accent: purple \n         - scheme: slate \n            toggle:\n               icon: material/toggle-switch\n               name: Switch to light mode    \n            primary: indigo\n            accent: lime\n    ```\n\n3. Save to apply the changes.\n4. Use the following command to rerun the website configuration:\n    ```bash\n    mkdocs serve\n    ```\n\n    When you refresh the website in your browser by visiting the same local host, you can see the changes. If you need to add more settings to your website configuration and add extensions, use the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) documentation.\n\n## Add pages\n\n**To add pages**\n\n1. Go to the project folder in VS Code.\n2. Select the **docs** folder.\n3. Select **New file**.\n4. Enter the file name and define the .md format.\nFor example, **anotherpage**.**md**.\n5. Save your file and open it.\n6. Add the text to be displayed on the newly added page.\n7. Save the changes.\nWhen you refresh the page, you can see the changes.\n![Changed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tannisanta/tt-techcomm-project/main/img/mkdocs_changes.jpg)\n\n## Publish website on GitHub\n\n**To prepare files for publishing**\n\n1. Open your website project in VS code.\n2. Create the **.github** folder.\n3. In the **.github** folder, create the **workflows** folder.\n4. In the the **workflows** folder, create **ci.yml** file.\n5. Paste the following code to the file:\n\n    ```yml\n    name: ci \n    on:\n      push:\n         branches:\n            - master \n            - main\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    jobs:\n      deploy:\n         runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n         steps:\n            - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n            - uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n            with:\n               python-version: 3.x\n            - uses: actions/cache@v4\n            with:\n               key: ${{ github.ref }}\n               path: .cache\n            - run: pip install mkdocs-material\n            - run: pip install pillow cairosvg\n            - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force\n    ```\n\n6. Save changes.\n7. Open you GitHub Desktop, add comment and commit changes to GitHub.\n8. Select **Push origin** to push changes to the origin remote repository.\nThe website project files are now stored on GitHub.\n\n**To publish website using GitHub pages**\n\n1. On GitHub, open the project repository.\n2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.\n3. For **Source**, leave **Deploy from a branch**.\n4. For **Branch**, select **gh-pages** and save.\n![GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tannisanta/tt-techcomm-project/main/img/mkdocs_github.jpg)\n5. Go to the **Actions** tab.\nYou can see that the website is being deployed to GitHub pages.\n6. Open the **pages build and deployment** and follow the link in **deploy** box.\nThe website is published.\n7. Add a direct link to the repository **About** section by opening settings, selecting the **Use your GitHub Pages website** checkbox, and saving the changes.\n![Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tannisanta/tt-techcomm-project/main/img/mkdocs_link.jpg)\n\nYou can know access your website and share it with others, make changes locally and push them to GitHub.
